# horseracing

This is the code for scraping historical data and data preprocessing. The latest versions are in a different repository, but this should give a good idea of what's going on.

Earlier versions of the modeling code can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vyaEWnmCBBQJkPk7TZIv71PsP6IpduHZ?usp=sharing

This project has been abandoned since the algorithm isn't scalable, so I am making the repo public.
